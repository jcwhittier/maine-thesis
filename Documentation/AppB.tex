\chapter{Change Log}
Changes in Bold were required by the Graduate School

\section{Changes in v1.14}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Figures and tables are correctly listed in the TOC when the subfig package is loaded. This is now handled by the class file instead of the user.}
\item{\bfseries Extra space before ``Chapter'' label in TOC has been removed.}
\item{\bfseries ``Chapter'' and ``Appendix'' in chapter headings is now printed in all uppercase.}
\item{\bfseries Tweaks to make 5-dot minimum in TOC leaders better respected.  Thanks to pmbean6 for this fix.}
\item{\bfseries Use a pronoun instead of author name for the last sentence of author biography.  Users now need to define their preferred pronoun with the \verb=\authorpronoun= command.  Do not forget to capitalize the first letter of the pronoun.  If no pronoun is provided, then the full author name will appear in the last sentence of the biography.}
\item{\bfseries When figure/table captions are too long to go into the table of contents, the graduate school wants the entry in the table of contents to match the first sentence of caption exactly.  To facilitate this the \verb=\caption= command has been redefined so that the optional argument, if given, is automatically prepended to the caption text.  Older theses, for which this new behavior would be undesirable, can turn it off with the legacycaptions option.}
\item{\bfseries On title page, when the name and title of an advisor or committee member is long enough to wrap to a second line, that second line will be indented 1.5em (the same as the indentation of a paragraph in the body of the thesis).}
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes in v1.13}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Short form of advisor's name can now be entered as an optional argument of \verb=\principaladvisor=.}
\item{Bugfix: idecimal and jdecimal heading styles were suppressing the section numbers.  Thanks to pmbean6 for this fix.}
\item{Margin widths have been tweaked a little so that they more closely conform to the guidelines.  Thanks to pmbean6 for this fix.}
\item{If you edited the class file to get justified text back, then subsection headings were being indented in jdecimal style.  This has been fixed in preparation for later changes.  Thanks to pmbean6 for this fix.}
\item{Package conflict with float package has been resolved.  Thanks to pmbean6 for this fix.  Those updating thesis should change listof environments to thesislist.}
\item{Bugfix: The default setting of \verb=\parindent= was being forced to 0, which was not as intended.}
\item{Indentation for the headings has been decoupled from \verb=\parindent= and is now tied to \verb=\headindent=.}
\item{Added some basic metadata (title and author) handling when hyperref is loaded.  Thanks to pmbean6 for this enhancement}
\item{\bfseries Adjusted page numbering to account for removal of Dissertation Acceptance page.}
